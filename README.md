If you know a format I have forgotten, please report it as an issue.   

###Lasercutting settings
The colour code for badge files is below   
   
__Black__ - Full cut   
__Red__ - Half power to a third power cut   
__Yellow__ - Quarter/Fifth power. As little power as you can get away with to create a line! Snaps easily if not.   
__Green__ - Optional raster engraving. Should be engraved a third power.   
   
A size reference cube has been included in each file plus size guides for at least 1 of the badges.   
   
There is also a python script included that can be used to pull names from 2 CSV files to auto build name badges.   
Check its separate readme.md file in the python folder for more information on this
